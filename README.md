## How The Game Works

The objective of the game is to guide the character to the water at the top of the screen. The only player control is the 4 direction keyboard arrows used to navigate the character; each push in a direction causes the character to advance once in that direction.

The player starts at the bottom of the screen, which contains a horizontal road occupied by bugs speeding along it. The player must guide the character between opposing lanes of traffic to avoid becoming roadkill, which results in starting over at the bottom. The player must avoid the bug.

The game ends once you reach the water.
